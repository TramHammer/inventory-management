Option 3
You have been hired to build a program for tracking the inventory within a stockroom warehouse.
The application must
• Store information to a file
    o File must contain
        ▪ Name of Item
        ▪ Short description of item
        ▪ Lowest number of stock for an item. If we get below this number, we need to
order more.
        ▪ Current number of items on hand
• Be able to enter data into your file
    o Add new items if don’t exist
    o Edit or delete items that already exist
• Request an Item by Name and show all related fields.
• Remove items from stock that have been given out. I.e. reduce the number of items on hand by
the number of items given out.
• Request report of all items that need to be ordered.
• Request a report of all items and how many of them are on hand.
